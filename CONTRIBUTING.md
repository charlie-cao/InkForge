# Contributing to InkForge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to InkForge! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or helping with translations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inkforge.git
   cd inkforge
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

5. **Install pre-commit hooks**:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

Run these tools before committing:

```bash
# Format code
black src tests

# Sort imports
isort src tests

# Lint code
flake8 src tests

# Type checking
mypy src
```

Or run all checks at once:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

We use pytest for testing. Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=inkforge

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test structure

Example test:
```python
def test_content_request_creation():
    """Test creating a content request."""
    request = ContentRequest(
        topic="Test Topic",
        country=Country.US
    )
    assert request.topic == "Test Topic"
    assert request.country == Country.US
```
